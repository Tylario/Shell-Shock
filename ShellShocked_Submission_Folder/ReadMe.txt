You play as a little Hermit Crab (named Creb, with a E). They are a little fella trying to make it to their home, a Sand Castle on the horizon. The only issue is that it's quite a distance away, so Creb has to take a nice and relaxing stroll through the beach to get to it. "There is absolutely NOTHING bad that could happen on their way there, nothing at all." ~Nodda Ceegoll.
